# Abstract
Genome-wide association studies have succeeded in identifying genetic variants associated with complex diseases, but the findings have not been well interpreted biologically. Although it is widely accepted that epistatic interactions of high-order single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)  are important causes of complex diseases, the combinatorial explosion of millions of SNPs and multiple tests impose a large computational burden. Moreover, it is extremely challenging to correctly distinguish high-order SNP epistatic interactions from other high-order SNP combinations due to small sample sizes. In this study, a multitasking harmony search algorithm (MTHSA-DHEI) is proposed for detecting high-order epistatic interactions, with the goal of simultaneously detecting multiple types of high-order (k1-order, k2-order, â€¦, kn-order) SNP epistatic interactions. Unified coding is adopted for multiple tasks, and four complementary association evaluation functions are employed to improve the capability of discriminating the high-order SNP epistatic interactions. We compare the proposed MTHSA-DHEI method with four excellent methods for detecting high-order SNP interactions for 8 high-order epistatic interaction models with no marginal effect (EINMEs) and 12 epistatic interaction models with marginal effects (EIMEs)  and implement the MTHSA-DHEI algorithm with a real dataset: age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The experimental results indicate that MTHSA-DHEI has power and an F1-score exceeding 90% for all EIMEs and five EINMEs and reduces the computational time by more than 90%. It can efficiently perform multiple high-order detection tasks for high-order epistatic interactions and improve the discrimination ability for diverse epistasis models.
